<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li> PHP3 or PHP4: <font class="warning">You should not run PowerPhlogger with 
    PHP3&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;3.0.9</font>. We recommend to use PHP4.<br />
    PHP also needs to be compiled with MySQL support; </li>
  <li> PHP has to be compiled with PCRE-support, <font class="warning">--with-pcre-regex[=DIR]</font> (enabled by default since PHP 4.2.0)</li>
  <li> MySQL (tested with 3.22.25 and 3.23.x); </li>
  <li> GD-lib with FreeType support enabled and FreeType linkage with TTF library</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<a name="install" id="install"></a> 
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p> <font class="warning">Warning for Mac users:</font> php seems not to like 
  Mac end of lines character (&quot;<tt>\r</tt>&quot;) and Stuffit unstuffs with 
  Mac formats, of course.<br />
  So you'll have to resave as in Bbedit to unix style ALL PowerPhlogger scripts 
  before uploading them to your server. </p>

<p>Quick Install:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories): 
    <tt>tar xzvf pphlogger-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt></li>
  <li> Open the file config.inc.php in your favourite editor and change the values 
    for host, user, password, and database to fit your environment.</li>
  <li> It is recommended that you protect the /admin/ directory (unless it's on 
    a closed intranet), for example with HTTP-AUTH (in a <i>.htaccess</i> file).</li>
  <li> Open the file <i>&lt;www.your-host.com&gt;/&lt;your-install-dir&gt;/admin/setup.php</i> 
    in your browser. PowerPhlogger now loads the default configuration. Check 
    the default configuration values and click 'next'. Go through the whole setup 
    procedure till you get to the admin-area.</li>
  <li>Start setting up new useraccounts in the admin area. Your users will get 
    notified automatically as soon as you create a new account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrading from an older version:<br />
  It is strongly recommended that you follow exact upgrade instructions! Please 
  always refer to the current instructions on <a href="http://www.phpee.com/upgrade.php" target="_blank">www.phpee.com/upgrade.php</a>.<br />
  Usually, you can stick to the following scheme, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li> After step 4 - running the setup.php script - you need to run the most 
    recent update script. For this version you will need to run <i>&lt;www.your-host.com&gt;/&lt;your-install-dir&gt;/upgrade/upd_2.2.2-2.2.2a.php</i></li>
  <li>If you're upgrading from an older version than 2.2.2, please run every upgrade 
    script separately in the correct order. You'll find them all in /upgrade/</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<a name="implement" id="implement"></a>
<h2>PPhlogger HTML Code</h2>
<p>PowerPhlogger gives you the possibility to track your entire Web Site. The 
  PPhlogger HTML code is able to automatically detect the name(s) and the Url(s) 
  of your pages.<br />
  You need to upload the pphlogger.js file to your server and place the PPhlogger 
  HTML code into all your Web site Pages. Both, you can find in your confirmation 
  email or - if you have lost that - when you enter your useraccount, in the &quot;settings&quot; 
  area.</p>
<a name="imp_standard" id="imp_standard"></a>
<h3>Standard Implementation</h3>
<p>Here's the code you should enter in your pages:</p>
<pre class="PPcode"> &lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;pphlogger.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /> &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/pphlogger.php?id=your_username&amp;st=img&quot;&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</pre>
<p>Make sure <code>src=&quot;pphlogger.js&quot;</code> is refering to the correct 
  location where you have placed your pphlogger.js. If you're not able to use 
  a relative path, use an absolute path like <code>src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/somewhere/pphlogger.js&quot;</code> 
  , this works the same.<br />
  For visibility options, please check the <a href="#vis_pphloggerjs">visibility 
  section</a>.
</p>
<a name="imp_special" id="imp_special"></a>
<h3>Special Implementation (PHP)</h3>
<p><font class="warning">WARNING</font>: All PowerPhlogger-users should use the standard 
  implementation described above!<br />
  The following special implementation is only for PPhlogger-admins who run their 
  site on the same server where the PPhlogger installation is located. Other users 
  that are not on the same server are not able to take advantage of this special 
  implementation at all!<br />
  Actually, I do not recommend to use this method as it hasn't been tested yet. 
  <br />
  <br />
  The main advantage by calling PowerPhlogger directly from PHP is, that PPhlogger 
  like this tracks every visitor, even search-bots that don't call up any JavaScript 
  or images on your site.<br />
  There are two ways of calling PPhlogger directly from PHP:</p>
<p><b>PHP only</b></p>
<p>Use this implementation if you would like to completely hide your counter. 
  No code at all will be visible on your site and you will be able to track anyone 
  entering your site.<br />
  Place the following code at the top of your page:<br />
</p>
<pre class="PPcode">&lt;?php<br />$id = &quot;username&quot;;<br />define('PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH', '/home/your_domain/htdocs/pphlogger/'); // relative (e.g. &quot;pphlogger/&quot;) or absolute path to your PP-directory<br />$st = 'php';<br />include(PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH.&quot;pphlogger.php&quot;);<br />?&gt;</pre>
<p> Please make sure, the code is definitely placed at the top of your script/page! 
  As PowerPhlogger sets cookies each time a visitor enters or reloads your pages, 
  it's not possible to call pphlogger.php after some other output.<br />
  If you do not place this code correctly, you would get the following error (unless 
  you set an output_buffering value in your php.ini):<br />
  <code><b>Warning:</b> Cannot add header information - headers already sent by 
  ...</code><br />
  There is another disadvantage: By calling pphlogger.php through PHP you won't 
  be able to track the visitor's screen resolution and color depth. Instead of 
  those values, you'll just find a zero-value in your logs. If you're worried 
  about that, read the next section and try to use the PHP&amp;JS combination.</p>
<p><b>PHP&amp;JS combination</b></p>
<p>Since PPhlogger 2.2.2 I've added this new way of calling PPhlogger. This is 
  the better solution the the PHP-only implementation.<br />
  That's how it works: You call pphlogger.php directly in PHP. The visitor get's 
  logged and pphlogger.php returns some JS-Code. This JS-Code calls up pphlogger.php 
  again (from client-side) in order to provide PPhlogger with the missing variables 
  that were not able to get directly in PHP.<br />
  Like this you will take advantage of the direct PHP logging and still will not 
  miss any data like the visitor's screen resolution and color depth.<br />
  <br />
  Use the following code and make sure this gets executed somewhere between the 
  &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">&lt;?php<br />$id = &quot;username&quot;;<br />define('PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH', '/home/your_domain/htdocs/pphlogger/'); // relative (e.g. &quot;pphlogger/&quot;) or absolute path to your PP-directory<br />$st = 'phpjs';
// $showme = 'y';<br />include(PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH.&quot;pphlogger.php&quot;);<br />?&gt;</pre>
<p>This is the ideal solution for webmasters who run PPhlogger on the same server 
  where they run their site(s). Actually this consumes a little bit more capacity 
  but that's no big deal (All other useraccounts are only able to call PPhlogger 
  by IMG/JS).</p>
<p>To make your counter visible (text-output), uncomment $showme = 'y';</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<a name="visibility" id="visibility"></a>
<h2>Visibility</h2>
<p>PowerPhlogger is able to make the counter visible on each user's site. Users 
  are not required to run PHP on their server. There are other possibilities to 
  make your counter visible. Since version 2.1.4 PowerPhlogger supports even text-output 
  - it's each user's own choice how to display their counter.<br />
  It's pretty hard to figure out how to do this correctly, so please read this 
  documentation.</p>
<a name="vis_userprofile" id="vis_userprofile"></a>
<h3>[1] userprofile settings</h3>
<p>When you log into your account, you'll find a tab 'userprofile'. That's the 
  place where you can change all basic settings of your account.<br />
  You'll find a checkbox 'visible'. This is the global switch for all counter 
  images/text on your whole site. If you uncheck this, you won't be able to make 
  your counter visible at any place. Default is checked and most of you probably 
  better keep it checked.<br />
  Below you'll find a pulldown-menu that contains TrueType-fonts. These fonts 
  are used for your counter image creation. Other counter scripts often use premade 
  images and you only got a choice between a limited number of styles. - Not in 
  PowerPhlogger! In PowerPhlogger you can choose your own TrueType fonts for your 
  counter image. If you can't find a suitable font just upload new ones into your 
  ttf_fonts/ directory.<br />
  below you'll find two color-palettes. The first one sets the foreground color, 
  the color of the letters. The second one sets the background-color. If you check 
  the 'transparent background'-checkbox, your background color will be transparent.Still 
  you should set a matching background-color to make your counter image look smoothly.<br />
  On the left side of the color-palettes you'll find an input-field that accepts 
  all three kind of color-notations:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
plain-text:   blue
RGB:          00+00+255
Hexadecimal:  #0000FF
</pre>
<p>Don't forget the insert the '+' if you use RGB format and don't forget to enter 
  '#' before a hexadecimal string.<br />
  By clicking on 'Save configuration' your result will be displayed on the bottom 
  (sample image). </p>
<a name="vis_pphloggerjs" id="vis_pphloggerjs"></a>
<h3>[2] pphlogger.js - visitor tracking</h3>
<p>In order to track your visitors, you need to upload pphlogger.js to your server. 
  This file transfers all the visitor's data to PowerPhlogger which could be located 
  on another machine that supports PHP. I'm not going to explain how exactly this 
  file acts but I want to make clear how to use it to make your counter visible.<br />
  Default is set to invisible. No matter if you checked 'visible' in your userprofile 
  or not!<br />
  The checkbox 'visible' in your userprofile is just kind of a global switch that 
  turns off all visibility. The visibility still has to be set on each page where 
  you want it to show up!<br />
  We're going to use the following two variables: <code><b>showme = 'y|n'</b></code> 
  and <code><b>st = 'js|img'</b></code>.<br />
  <code>st</code> stands for &quot;show-type&quot; and specifies the way how your 
  visitors should get tracked. <code>showme</code> is the local switch for visibility.<br />
  <br />
  valid values for the <i>st</i> variable:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
<b>st='js'</b>      for text output (DEFAULT)
<b>st='img'</b>     for image output
</pre>
<p>If you wish to make your counter visible, you need to set showme = 'y'</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
<b>showme='n'</b>   invisible (DEFAULT)
<b>showme='y'</b>   visible
</pre>
<p>Ok, basically your PowerPhlogger code that you insert on each page, looks like 
  this:</p>
<pre class="PPcode"> &lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;pphlogger.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /> &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/pphlogger.php?id=your_username&amp;st=img&quot;&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</pre>
<p>As default is <code>showme = 'n'</code> and <code>st = 'js'</code>, your counter 
  would be completely invisible. In order to change mode insert another line before 
  those two lines:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
 &lt;script&gt;<b>showme='y'; st='js'</b>&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;pphlogger.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /> &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/pphlogger.php?id=your_username&amp;st=img&quot;&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</pre>
<p>This example would make your counter visible and show it as text. Same thing 
  with image-output, just change the <i>st</i> variable to 'img' - then you'll 
  be able to see the nice image you have created in you userprofile.<br />
  I do not recommend to use the combination <code>st='y'; showme='n'</code> as 
  this would output a 1x1 pixel image. It's cleaner to handle invisibility through 
  the 'js'-output = empty string!</p>
<a name="vis_showhits" id="vis_showhits"></a> 
<h3>[3] showhits.php</h3>
<p>Above you found a description of how to make the counter visible on your page. 
  Let's say you put the PowerPhlogger-code in the footer of your pages and you 
  wish to display it somewhere else on your page... or let's say you would like 
  to show the number of people currently online or the number of hits of the current 
  day.<br />
  showhits.php can do a lot!<br />
  Its purpose is just to display different information and not to track visitors. 
  showhits.php will not alter anything in your database.<br />
  There are 3 different ways to display showhits.php:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
st='js'      for text output (DEFAULT)
st='php'     for text output (if PowerPhlogger is located on the same server)
st='img'     for image output
</pre>
<p>The appropriate usage for those 3 modes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>JavaScript</b> [<code>st = 'js'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/showhits.php?id=username&amp;st=js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>PHP</b> [<code>st = 'php'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;?php
define('PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH', '../pphlogger/'); // relative or absolute server path to your pphlogger-dir
$id = &quot;username&quot;;
$st = 'php';
include (PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH.&quot;showhits.php&quot;); ?&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>Image-tag</b> [<code>st = 'img'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/showhits.php?id=username&amp;st=img&quot;&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The variable <i>showme</i> has no meaning in showhits.php - it is always set 
  to 'y'. If you would not like to make it visible, you wouldn't call this script, 
  right?! This script is only meant to display stuff, that's why it is always 
  visible.</p>
<p>There's a couple of more things that showhits.php can display. It can output 
  today's hits, today's pageimpressions, this month's hits/pageimpressions, current 
  online users, amount of customers, total pageimpressions, download hits etc.<br />
  For, you just need to add another variable the code that has been described 
  above: <i>type</i></p>
<pre class="PPcode">
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 type=   hits | pageviews | today | todayviews | yesterday | yesterdayhits |
         month | monthviews | onlineusr | customers | mpdl
 mpdl=   /your_url


         description:
         hits:           shows total hits (default)
         pageviews:      shows total pageimpressions
         today:          shows today's hits
         todayviews:     shows today's pageimpressions
         yesterday:      shows yesterday's hits
         yesterdayviews: shows yesterday's pageimpressions
         month:          shows current month's hits
         monthviews:     shows current month's pageimpressions
         onlineusr:      shows current online users
         customers:      shows amount of activated useraccounts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Let's make an example: You wish to display the current online users as text 
  in your page:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>JavaScript</b> [<code>st = 'js'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/showhits.php?id=username&amp;st=js<b>&amp;type=onlineusr</b>&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>PHP</b> [<code>st = 'php'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;?php
define('PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH', '../pphlogger/'); // relative or absolute server path to your pphlogger-dir
$id = &quot;username&quot;;
<b>$type = &quot;onlineusr&quot;;</b>
$st = 'php';
include (PPHL_SCRIPT_PATH.&quot;showhits.php&quot;); ?&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, lets say you wish to display how many times /files/myfile.zip got downloaded. 
  You wish to display this as an image (sure, you can display it also as txt using 
  Javascript or PHP !): </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Image-tag</b> [<code>st = 'img'</code>]:<br />
    <pre class="PPcode">
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.your_domain.com/pphlogger/showhits.php?id=username&amp;st=img<b>&amp;mpdl=/files/myfile.zip</b>&quot;&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I hope that was clear enough.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<a name="urlhandling" id="urlhandling"></a> 
<h2>URL handling</h2>
<p><b>dynamic website</b></p>
<p>A URL can be structured into the following components: &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;<br />
  Usually people do not want to store the whole URL into PowerPhlogger's logging 
  table. In the multi-page list we do not want to make any difference between 
  URLs with various different query-strings. e.g. abc.php?f=4&amp;i=2136&amp;t=2066 
  should be handled the same as abc.php or abc.php?f=4&amp;i=2000&amp;t=2015. 
  Usually we don't want to store the whole URL including the whole query-string.<br />
  <br />
  Now, let's say you're using a dynamically built site that is just made of one 
  single page. e.g. we only got list.php and the actual content of this page gets 
  generated out of the information located in the query-part of the URL. That's 
  where we actually need to distinguish between URLs with various different query-strings.<br />
  At this point we're using the &quot;short query&quot; user setting. Each user 
  can specify his own query-strings that he wish to get logged. He has to enter 
  the query-strings into the textbox, each separated by a newline.<br />
  <br />
  example:<br />
  <br />
</p>
<pre class="PPcode">http://www.abc.com/abc.php?date=200111&amp;s=d46df4e47043bfab5d08fee9d24e0146&amp;threadid=100&amp;page=news

short query:
------------
| date     |
| page     |
------------

result:
-------
http://www.abc.com/abc.php?date=200111&amp;page=news</pre>
<p>By specifying &quot;date&quot; and &quot;page&quot; we're able to cut the query-string 
  down to those two values and stripping off all the other stuff. e.g. we don't 
  need to store the session-ID (s=d46df4e47043bfab5d08fee9d24e0146).</p>
<p>If we enter a &quot;*&quot; as short query string, then nothing will be stripped 
  off and PowerPhlogger will keep the whole query-string.<br />
</p>
<pre class="PPcode">http://www.abc.com/abc.php?date=200111&amp;s=d46df4e47043bfab5d08fee9d24e0146&amp;threadid=100&amp;page=news

short query:
------------
| *        |
------------

result:
-------
http://www.abc.com/abc.php?date=200111&amp;s=d46df4e47043bfab5d08fee9d24e0146&amp;threadid=100&amp;page=news</pre>
<p>As default, the &quot;short query&quot;-string is empty. That way PowerPhlogger 
  would strip off the whole query string.</p>
<p><b>index.* --&gt; /</b></p>
<p>This list is for those who would like to handle &quot;index.*&quot; as &quot;/&quot;.<br />
  Enter all index.* into this setting box, separated by newlines, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="PPcode">
---------------
| index.html  |
| index.php   |
| index.phtml |
---------------
</pre>

<h2>download counter - dlcount.php</h2>
<p>There's a download counter integrated in PowerPhlogger. In order to use it 
  you just need to modify your links:</p>
<p>
use this syntax, if yourfile.zip is located relative to your primary URL (the first URL you set in your userprofile):</p>
<pre class="PPcode">

 &lt;a href=&quot;[path_to_pphlogger]/<b>dlcount.php</b>?id=[username]&amp;<b>url=/yourfile.zip</b>&quot;&gt;yourfile.zip&lt;/a&gt;

</pre>
<p>
If the file is located anywhere else, use an absolute path:
</p>
<pre class="PPcode">

 &lt;a href=&quot;[path_to_pphlogger]/<b>dlcount.php</b>?id=[username]&amp;<b>url=http://www.somewhereelse.com/yourfile.zip</b>&quot;&gt;yourfile.zip&lt;/a&gt;

</pre>
<p>
Make sure you enter your correct username (without brakets '[]')!<br />
[path_to_pphlogger] must be the correct path to your pphlogger-directory, e.g. 
http://www.abc.com/pphlogger/

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Any PHP errors about function &quot;imagecreate&quot; does not exist indicates 
    that your PHP installation does not include the GD library. This must be present.<br />
    If you're not able to get GD to work, try to set GD's image-type manually 
    in /admin/setup.php step 3. If you can't get it running at all set <code>GD_enabled 
    = false</code> in step 3.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>If you are running PHP 4.06 and get an error saying &quot;GD was not built 
    with truetype support&quot; you should know that this is a known problem with 
    GD+PHP 4.06. There are some workarounds (search the net!) but it is really 
    recommended that you instead upgrade to at least PHP 4.1.1 and configure PHP 
    with --with-gd-native-ttf (Please also note that the built in TTF uses point 
    size for fonts whereas Truetype 2 uses pixels.)<br />
    Please DON't ask me how to resolve the GD Font problem. All mail regarding 
    this will go straight to /dev/null. Upgrade to 4.1.1!<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>If you're using PHP 4.1.x and you're not able to see the counter image on 
    your userprofile settings page, this may be a another bug in PHP/GD. Run /admin/setup.php 
    and edit the ttf_location setting in step 3. Default is &quot;relative&quot;. 
    Change it to an absolute path to your ttf_fonts-dir: e.g. &quot;/home/yourpage_com/htdocs/pphlogger/ttf_fonts/&quot;.<br />
    This bug has been reported to the PHP-group: <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15212">http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15212</a></li>

<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p> <b>What's this CSS-editor for?</b> <br />
  Since PowerPhlogger 2.2.0 we're no longer using static CSS files. You may have 
  noticed, that there is just one single CSS file located in the /css/ directory: 
  common.css<br />
  The main idea: Use a single CSS file and generate the color content dynamically. 
  Like this we got just one standardized CSS file in which we need to make changes. 
  I guess the user still got enough choices. He can adjust a lot of colors by 
  creating his own CSS profiles using the CSS editor.<br />
  A user can enter the CSS editor through the userprofile-page where he'll find 
  a link below the CSS pull-down menu.<br />
  There are default styles and user specific styles. If a user wants to create 
  a new style, he just takes an existing one, clicks on 'edit' and he'll be able 
  to enter his color values - e.g. 'blue' or '0000FF' or '0+0+255' - the form 
  accepts pretty every color string syntax. If the user edits his own profile 
  he'll be able to save it. If it's a default profile, he'll be just able to create 
  a new one based on the one he selected.</p>
<p><b>When I'm trying to create a new useraccount, there's the message &quot;<i>Sorry, 
  currently we cannot offer any free accounts on this server !</i>&quot; showing 
  up...</b><br />
  When setting up PowerPhlogger, you forgot to set &quot;Enable User Self-Signup&quot; 
  to true. You'll find this value in the setup-process step 1. Go to /admin/ and 
  enter the setup procedure.</p>
<p><b>When do I need to press the [ clean-up ] link in the bottom-right corner 
  of the calendar?</b><br />
  The [ clean-up ] is only used if your calendar is somehow messed-up. Usually 
  this should NEVER happen, so you don't actually ever need to use this link.<br />
  If you click on it, all you calendar information will be deleted and recalculated 
  (without affecting any logs! don't worry :). If you got a huge amount of logs 
  in your logs-table (by &quot;huge&quot; I mean like 200 logs/day throughout 
  a whole year...) then it may take a long time to recalculate. Due to the maximum 
  execution time that is usually set to 30 seconds the script may break. Just 
  reload it again and again till you see the calendar. While it is running DO 
  NOT RELOAD! Always wait till it is done.<br />
  Due to an enormous server load, this [ clean-up ] link has been disabled for 
  users who are just logged in as guests.</p>
<p><b>What does &quot;mp&quot; mean?</b><br />
  mp stands for &quot;multi-page&quot; and is the amount of pageimpressions by 
  user. It shows how many pages a user was viewing and how many reloads he has 
  done.</p>
<p><b>I'd like to contribute to a translation into my language. What do I need 
  to translate?</b><br />
  Currently there are four files you need to translate: /lang/xx.inc.php, /lang/xx_tld.inc.php, 
  /messages/email_newuser_xx.txt, and /messages/email_notif_xx.txt<br />
  The /lang/xx.inc.php is the main language localization file. Please name it 
  with a two digit language code (xx).<br />
  Take e.g. en.inc.php as template and replace all language strings with your 
  translation. Otherwise please don't make any changes in this file. We'll take 
  care of it to import your translated files into our next distribution.<br />
  We're always happy about new translations! Thanks to everyone who'd like to 
  contribute!</p>
<p><b>What's showhits.php for?</b><br />
  showhits.php makes your counter visible. By calling this script you'll be able 
  to show the following information:<br />
  [type] = hits | pageviews | today | todayviews | yesterday | yesterdayhits | 
  month | monthviews | onlineusr | customers<br />
  For further information please check: <a href="#vis_showhits">showhits.php usage</a></p>
<p><b>How do I track referrers on a framed site?</b><br />
  edit your pphlogger.js file:<br />
  uncomment (remove the '//') the following line on top of the file: <code>pp_frames 
  = TRUE;</code><br />
  WARNING: This may cause a Javascript security error on several browsers in case 
  your frameset is not located on the same domain. For people using a &quot;stealth 
  frame&quot; like Namezero or MyDomain offers, it will be impossible to track 
  referrers!</p>
<p><b>I need to use .php3 or some other extension, not .php</b><br />
  The extension .php is the prefered default extension for all PHP4 versions. 
  It is the extension used by the PHP team and Zend.com. For this reason, PowerPhlogger 
  comes with this extension.<br />
  The easiest way is to use this extension is to make Apache or your webserver 
  parse these as PHP files. In Apache you need to add a line like: <br />
  <code>AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php</code><br />
  <br />
  If that is not an option, you can change it by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>change ALL .php file extensions to your new extension. You can do this manually 
    or by using the following script: <i>/upgrade/extchange.php</i> (see instructions 
    inside the file!)</li>
  <li>edit main_location.inc and change <code>define('CFG_PHPEXT', 'php');</code> to your 
    new extension</li>
</ol>
<p><b>How do make download-hits visible on my page?</b><br />
  Use showhits.php and call it up through an IMG-Tag, PHP, or JavaScript.<br />
  Check the instructions inside showhits.php and check the samples above: <a href="#vis_showhits">showhits.php 
  usage</a><br />
  Instead of using type=[type] you specify the download-URL: mpdl=/your_url/...
