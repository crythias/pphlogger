  Not just a simple access counter. Power Phlogger lets you offer counter 
  services to others from your site.
  It requires PHP3 and mySQL. It's been tested on PHP 3.0.17 and all
  PHP4-releases (PHP 4.0.x - 4.3.2), mySQL 3.22.32 up to 3.23.51 and
  mySQL 4.0.13
  running on Apache under Linux / win32.
  In order to make your hits visible you need the GD-lib.
  For installation please check INSTALL !
