Fork of pphlogger

PowerPhlogger is a counter hosting and website statistics tool.
The home of PowerPhlogger is located at: http://pphlogger.phpee.com
Active development of PowerPhlogger has been stopped as of August 2006.

I've upgraded the source so it runs under PHP7.
And added support for IPv6 and new browser/OS detection.
